      Was thinking of defining an index variable, and using an if statement here
      
      
      to display the next group of questions, the rest of page 1 on the form.
      
      
      you would return to this page after doing that part and have both the 
      
      
      
      first and second groups of data with an edit button. For the other 
      
      
      persons part cna do that with gathering, asking, is there another, 
      
      
      enabling any number of other persons to be added, untill user selects 
      
      
      finish adding. that should be optional page as enquiry may not need other
      
      
      persons.
