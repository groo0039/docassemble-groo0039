  MYindex = 0 # Control index to increment, " MYindex = MYindex + 1 ", before displaying the next single persons' data for verification. I used gathering to record the verification response for each person , and store the response in the object defined below, "varlist", as a list of strings: 'Yes' or 'No'. Problem: My get one person's data code block for verificatin "DJGonerow", below, always displays the first persons data, DJGperson_info[0]. the Second verification should display the second persons data, DJGperson_info[1], and so forth.
